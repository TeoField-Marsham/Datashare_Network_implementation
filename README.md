# DATASHARE NETWORK Implementation

By: Teo Field-Marsham

### TO DO:
- function to take a hash and define it under a group G python
- get benchmarking tables for presentation  
- start working on the readme project report

Temporary notes:
Both sets should now be G^(H(kwd) * client_secret * server_secret) before computing the intersection

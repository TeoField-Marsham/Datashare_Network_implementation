# DATASHARE NETWORK Implementation

By: Teo Field-Marsham

### TO DO:
- function to take a hash and define it under a group G python
- get benchmarking tables for presentation  
- start working on the readme project report

Temporary notes:
N is specefied in the protocol because it may be useful for performance optimizations or bounding loops in a theoretical implementation.
Some implementations might also rely on N to preallocate memory or track progress.
